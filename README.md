**#Assignment 1 : 8 Queen Problem using UCS**
-----------------------------------------
Here we are solving the **8queen** problem by applying **UCS(Uniform Cost Search)** Algorithm. In the algo we try to explore valid states. 
Cost of every move is consiered to be 1.  

For Windows : Open it in an IDE, compile and run.

For Linux   : run g++ 8QueenUCS.cpp, and run the resulting a.out. Output will show in terminal


**#Assignment 2 : 8Queen Problem using A\***
---------------------------------------
Here we are solving **8Queen** Problem by using the **A\*** Algorithm. We explore every valid state, and print all the results.
Cost of every move is considered to be 1.  

For Windows : Open it in an IDE, compile and run.

For Linux   : run g++ 8QueenA_Star.cpp, and run the resulting a.out. Output will show in terminal


**#Assignment 3 : Genetic Algorithm**
---------------------------------
Here we input number of students at the start of the program, and the code will run upto a thousand generations and print the fittest member. 

For Windows : Open it in an IDE, compile and run.

For Linux   : run g++ Genetic.cpp, and run the resulting a.out. Output will show in terminal.


**#Assignment 4 : Game of Sticks**
------------------------------
The cpp file covers **AI vs AI** and **AI vs Player** options for the **Stick Game**. On execution, program will ask which mode you want to run in. Then it does a toss
and explains the rule. The winner of the toss starts first, and has to remove 1-3 sticks.

For Windows : Open it in an IDE, compile and run.

For Linux   : run g++ Stick.cpp, and run the resulting a.out. Output will show in terminal.

**Instructions for Output.txt**
---------------------------
Output.txt included in the repo contains a solution for each of the assignments. To search in the txt file, open it in any text editor, and search within the file for
Assignment [number] or cpp file name.
For example, Find  "Assignment 1" or "8QueenUCS.cpp" to go to the sample output for that program/assignment. Input used for particular output is mentioned at the top.
